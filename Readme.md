# Mafs
A library for handling vector and matrix operations <br />
Currently supports:
 - Arbitrary sized vectors and matrices
 - Subscript [] or access specify the xyzw components of a vector
 - Performing arithmetic on vectors
 - Composing square matrices
 - Transforming arbitrary vectors by arbitrary matrices
 - Dot product
 - Get the magnitude of or normalise a vector
 - Get the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix
 - Transpose arbitrary matrices
 - Get the unit vector along a certain dimension
 - Check linear dependance of vectors

More stuff will be added soon, including:
 - Gaussian elimination
 - Generate common matrices (identity, common transformations)
 - Row-echelon form
 - Performance optimisation
 - Rotation matrix given angle
 - Find inverse matrix
 - Cross product of course
 - Possibly a swizzling system
 - Cofactor and adjunct matrices

`Mafs.hh` is the library, `Mafs.cc` contains some usage examples
