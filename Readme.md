# Mafs
A library for handling vector, matrix, and quaternion operations <br />
Currently supports:
 - Arbitrary sized vectors and matrices
 - Composing square matrices
 - Transforming arbitrary vectors by arbitrary matrices
 - Dot and cross products
 - Get the magnitude of or normalise a vector
 - Get the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix
 - Transpose arbitrary matrices
 - Get unit vectors, identity matrices, and identity quaternion
 - Quaternions to and from euler angles
 - Quaternions to rotation matrices
 - Interpolate quaternions
 - Conjugate, invert, normalise quaternions

More stuff will be added soon, including:
 - Gaussian elimination
 - Performance optimisation
 - More conversion functions
 - Find inverse matrix
 - Possibly a swizzling system
 - Cofactor and adjunct matrices

`Mafs.hh` is the library, `Mafs.cc` contains some usage examples
